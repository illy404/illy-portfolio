              Hi there! Iâ€™m Illy, an artist on a journey through digital art and mixed media. What started with a simple set of color pencils has grown into a deep exploration of cartoon and semi-realism styles. To me, each piece is an adventure and a chance to discover something new. I hope my work connects with you as much as it does with me, capturing stories and emotions along the way.
